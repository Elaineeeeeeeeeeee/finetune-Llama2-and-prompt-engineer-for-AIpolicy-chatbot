Q: What are the critical global discussions surrounding the governance, access, and sharing of data, particularly in relation to AI development and its broader societal impacts?
A: Access to and sharing of data are critical to enable AI’s benefits across sectors. Policies must encourage data access and sharing while addressing associated risks, for countries to harness the full potential. In many countries, policymakers and regulators face difficulties finding common definitions and common ground in discussions, cooperation, and coordination on data governance, at national and international levels. They focus on aspects relevant to their policy domains and jurisdiction. Therefore, data should be governed to maximize its benefits while addressing risks and challenges, including protecting the rights of individuals and organizations. This requires comprehensive policy to address cross-cutting challenges while accounting for the specificities of data governance in domains like trade or competition (OECD, forthcoming[19]). These include: First, Balancing the trade-offs between data openness and control. The more openly data is accessed, shared and re-used (for example, with open data), the higher its potential social and economic benefits, but also the greater the associated risks. Second, Addressing potentially conflicting interests and regulations. Data collected and used to inform AI systems are often (co-)created by the interaction of many stakeholders in the global data ecosystem, in some cases without them being aware. Facilitating data access and sharing for AI requires disentangling and reconciling these interests and data-governance frameworks. Third, Aligning incentives for investment in data and its re-use. While the marginal costs of transmitting, copying and processing data can be close to zero, substantial investment is often required to generate and collect data and enable data sharing and re-use for AI. Fair distribution of the benefits from data can help address incentive challenges.

The advisory bodies also have experience in developing normative instruments, including the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights in 1997 and the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights in 2005. Second, UNESCO ensure that Africa fully participates in transformations related to AI, not only as a beneficiary but also upstream, contributing directly to its development. In terms of gender equality, UNESCO fights against the biases in the societies to guarantee that they are not reproduced in AI applications. Finally, UNESCO empower young people by providing them with the skills they need for life in the twenty-first century for integration in a changing labour market. Third, UNESCO also has a key role to play in bridging existing divides, which AI is likely to deepen. Eliminating fragmentation between countries and genders, but also in terms of resources and knowledge, could enable more people to contribute to the digital transformation underway. What's more, UNESCO, with its humanist mission and international dimension, involving researchers, philosophers, programmers, policymakers, and private sector and civil society representatives, is the natural home for debate on such ethical issues. Last but not least, UNESCO is performing its role to the fullest, informing the global debate on the major transformations of its time while establishing principles to ensure that technological advances are used to serve the common good. The promise of AI and its underlying ethical issues are fascinating, and UNESCO responses to these challenges will transform the world as UNESCO knows it.
