Q: In the context of leveraging AI across sectors like healthcare and transportation, what are the important issues in the field of global data access, sharing, and governance, especially regarding balancing openness with control and reconciling conflicting interests?
A: Access to and sharing of data are critical to enable AI’s benefits across sectors. Policies must encourage data access and sharing while addressing associated risks, for countries to harness the full potential.  In  many  countries,  policymakers  and  regulators  face  difficulties  finding  common  definitions  and common  ground  in  discussions,  co-operation  and  coordination  on  data  governance,  at  national  and international levels. They focus on aspects relevant to their policy domains and jurisdiction. Therefore, data should  be governed to  maximise  its  benefits while addressing  risks  and challenges, including protecting the rights of individuals and organisations. This requires comprehensive policy to address cross-cutting challenges, while accounting for the specificities of data governance in domains like trade or competition (OECD, forthcoming[19]). These include:
First, Balancing  the  trade-offs  between  data  openness  and  control.  The  more  openly  data  is accessed, shared and re-used (for example, with open data), the higher its potential social and economic benefits, but also the greater the associated risks. Second, Addressing potentially conflicting interests and regulations. Data collected and used to inform AI systems are often  (co-)created  by the  interaction of many stakeholders  in the global data ecosystem, in some cases without them being aware. Facilitating data access and sharing for AI requires disentangling and reconciling these interests and data-governance frameworks. Third, Aligning  incentives  for  investment  in  data  and   its  re-use.  While  the  marginal  costs  of transmitting, copying and processing data can be close to zero, substantial investment is often required to generate and collect data and enable data sharing and re-use for AI. Fair distribution of the benefits from data can help address incentive challenges.


Q: Reflecting on the global race for AI dominance, what are the investment projects in AI research and development across various countries, including the United States' billion-dollar initiative and the EU's Horizon 2020 programme?

Budgets for AI R&D vary across countries. Since 2020, the United States dedicates USD 1 billion or more annually to non-defence AI R&D and created national AI research institutes. The EU Horizon 2020 programme committed EUR 1.5 billion to AI research over two years and expected an additional EUR 20 billion in 2020 
from the private sector and member states, with the Horizon Europe programme continuing these efforts.


Q: Given the rapid pace of AI technological advancements, what education programs related to AI are being developed among countries to support vocational training, lifelong learning, and the attraction of top AI talent?

Co-operation on AI research is also a priority.


Q: Considering the critical role of infrastructure in AI advancements, what aspects should be focused on in the hardware field for the development of AI, including machine learning models, connectivity, and computing infrastructure?
A: First, It includes using Machine learning models and techniques to learn in an automated manner through patterns and inferences rather than explicit instructions from a human. Second, Connectivity allows the transfer of large volumes of data in real or quasi-real time, while computing infrastructure (hardware and software) executes the mathematical operations needed to calibrate or "train" an AI system and infer its results. The combination of high-quality connectivity, data, computing infrastructure and AI technologies continues to enable innovative and disruptive new services.

Q: In light of concerns over AI's societal impact, such as privacy breaches and gender discrimination, can you provide examples of the ethical issues raised by artificial intelligence and the measures proposed to address these concerns?
A: Sure, here are some examples. How can we ensure that algorithms do not infringe fundamental human rights—from privacy and data confidentiality to freedom of choice and freedom of conscience? Can freedom of action be guaranteed when our desires are anticipated and guided? How can we ensure that social and cultural stereotypes are not replicated in AI programming, notably when it comes to gender discrimination? Can these circuits be duplicated? Can values be programmed, and by whom? How can we ensure accountability when decisions and actions are fully automated? How do we make sure that no one—wherever they are in the world—is deprived of the benefits of these technologies? How do we ensure that AI is developed in a transparent way, so that global citizens, whose lives it affects, have a say in its development?


Q: With UNESCO's extensive experience in the ethics of science and technology, what role does it play in promoting global dialogue on AI ethics, and how does it aim to ensure inclusivity, gender equality, and youth empowerment in AI development?
A: First, UNESCO will be a full and active participant in this global conversation. The organization has many years of experience in the ethics of science and technology. Its advisory bodies have already produced numerous reports and declarations, including on robotics, such as the Report of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology on Robotics Ethics in 2017. The advisory bodies also have experience in developing normative instruments, including the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights in 1997 and the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights in 2005. Second, UNESCO ensure that Africa fully participates in transformations related to AI, not only as a beneficiary but also upstream, contributing directly to its development. In terms of gender equality, UNESCO fights against the biases in the societies to guarantee that they are not reproduced in AI applications. Finally, UNESCO empower young people by providing them with the skills they need for life in the twenty-first century for integration in a changing labour market. Third, UNESCO also has a key role to play in bridging existing divides, which AI is likely to deepen. Eliminating fragmentation between countries and genders, but also in terms of resources and knowledge, could enable more people to contribute to the digital transformation underway. What's more, UNESCO, with its humanist mission and international dimension, involving researchers, philosophers, programmers, policymakers, and private sector and civil society representatives, is the natural home for debate on such ethical issues. Last but not least, UNESCO is performing its role to the fullest, informing the global debate on the major transformations of its time while establishing principles to ensure that technological advances are used to serve the common good. The promise of AI and its underlying ethical issues are fascinating, and UNESCO responses to these challenges will transform the world as UNESCO knows it.
