Policies must encourage data access and sharing while addressing associated risks, for countries to harness the full potential. In many countries, policymakers and regulators face difficulties finding common definitions and common ground in discussions, cooperation, and coordination on data governance, at national and international levels. They focus on aspects relevant to their policy domains and jurisdiction. Therefore, data should be governed to maximize its benefits while addressing risks and challenges, including protecting the rights of individuals and organizations. This requires comprehensive policy to address cross-cutting challenges while accounting for the specificities of data governance in domains like trade or competition (OECD, forthcoming[19]). These include: First, Balancing the trade-offs between data openness and control. The more openly data is accessed, shared and re-used (for example, with open data), the higher its potential social and economic benefits, but also the greater the associated risks. Second, Addressing potentially conflicting interests and regulations. Data collected and used to inform AI systems are often (co-)created by the interaction of many stakeholders in the global data ecosystem, in some cases without them being aware. Facilitating data access and sharing for AI requires disentangling and reconciling these interests and data-governance frameworks. Third, Aligning incentives for investment in data and its re-use. While the marginal costs of transmitting, copying and processing data can be close to zero, substantial investment is often required to generate and collect data and enable data sharing and re-use for AI. Fair distribution of the benefits from data can help address incentive challenges.'}, {'input': 'How are various countries investing in AI research and development, and what strategies are they employing to foster innovation and collaboration in this field?', 'output': 'Countries are funding national AI-related research institutes and projects through grants; consolidating AI research networks and collaborative platforms; prioritising AI investments in specific sectors; pursuing AI-related mission-oriented innovation policies; and procuring AI systems for the public sector.

Policies must encourage data access and sharing while addressing associated risks, for countries to harness the full potential. In many countries, policymakers and regulators face difficulties finding common definitions and common ground in discussions, cooperation, and coordination on data governance, at national and international levels. They focus on aspects relevant to their policy domains and jurisdiction. Therefore, data should be governed to maximize its benefits while addressing risks and challenges, including protecting the rights of individuals and organizations. This requires comprehensive policy to address cross-cutting challenges while accounting for the specificities of data governance in domains like trade or competition (OECD, forthcoming[19]). These include: First, Balancing the trade-offs between data openness and control. The more openly data is accessed, shared and re-used (for example, with open data), the higher its potential social and economic benefits, but also the greater the associated risks. Second, Addressing potentially conflicting interests and regulations. Data collected and used to inform AI systems are often (co-)created by the interaction of many stakeholders in the global data ecosystem, in some cases without them being aware. Facilitating data access and sharing for AI requires disentangling and reconciling these interests and data-governance frameworks. Third, Aligning incentives for investment in data and its re-use. While the marginal costs of transmitting, copying and processing data can be close to zero, substantial investment is often required to generate and collect data and enable data sharing and re-use for AI. Fair distribution of the benefits from data can help address incentive challenges.'}, {'input': 'How are various countries investing in AI research and development, and what strategies are they employing to foster innovation and collaboration in this field?', 'output': 'Countries are funding national AI-related research institutes and projects through grants; consolidating AI research networks and collaborative platforms; prioritising AI investments in specific sectors; pursuing AI-related mission-oriented innovation policies; and procuring AI systems for the public sector.

Policies must encourage data access and sharing while addressing associated risks, for countries to harness the full potential. In many countries, policymakers and regulators face difficulties finding common definitions and common ground in discussions, co-operation and coordination on data governance, at national and international levels. They focus on aspects relevant to their policy domains and jurisdiction. Therefore, data should be governed to maximise its benefits while addressing risks and challenges, including protecting the rights of individuals and organisations. This requires comprehensive policy to address cross-cutting challenges, while accounting for the specificities of data governance in domains like trade or competition (OECD, forthcoming[19]). These include: First, Balancing the trade-offs between data openness and control. The more openly data is accessed, shared and re-used (for example, with open data), the higher its potential social and economic benefits, but also the greater the associated risks. Second, Addressing potentially conflicting interests and regulations. Data collected and used to inform AI systems are often (co-)created by the interaction of many stakeholders in the global data ecosystem, in some cases without them being aware. Facilitating data access and sharing for AI requires disentangling and reconciling these interests and data-governance frameworks. Third, Aligning incentives for investment in data and its re-use. While the marginal costs of transmitting, copying and processing data can be close to zero, substantial investment is often required to generate and collect data and enable data sharing and re-use for AI. Fair distribution of the benefits from data can help address incentive challenges.'}, {'input': 'How are various countries investing in AI research and development, and what strategies are they employing to foster innovation and collaboration in this field?', 'output': 'Countries are funding national AI-related research institutes and projects through grants; consolidating AI research networks and collaborative platforms; prioritising AI investments in specific sectors; pursuing AIrelated mission-oriented innovation policies; and procuring AI systems for the public sector.
